# EventBuddy
Discover. Check In. Connect. 



EventBuddy was developed as a midterm team project in the UT-Austin Web Development Bootcamp. Our goal was to help people meet and connect with new people at events they were attending. Many social media applications have this capability, but are not built for this purpose. Two people may be attending an event, but not necessarily seeking out new friendships. EventBuddy makes  intentions clear and connection easy.
